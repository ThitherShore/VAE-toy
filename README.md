# VAE-toy-and-talk
VAE implementation in python

### Requirements
Python 3

Tensorflow 1.0 or higher

Keras

### Files
`vae-simple.py` is an easy-to-read version of VAE.

`vae.py` is a modified version of `vae.py` with more experiment settings.

`exps_diff_latent.py` and `exps_multiple.py` are used for summarizing the experiment results and plotting.

### Corresponding talk on VAE

I have added both pdf file and LaTeX source file of the slides, includingï¼š

- Explainnation of VAE & variational inference & variational lower bound
- Toy VAE numerical experiments on MINST
